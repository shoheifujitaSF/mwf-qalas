# Vendor-Agnostic Joint Relaxometry and Myelin Water Fraction Mapping with B<sub>1</sub> and Motion Correction

This is the official code for **"Vendor-Agnostic Joint Relaxometry and Myelin Water Fraction Mapping with B<sub>1</sub>  and Motion Correction"**.
A related abstract is published at [2025 ISMRM & ISMRT Annual Meeting & Exhibition](https://www.ismrm.org/25m/).

A vendor-agnostic sequence for joint and rapid acquisition of T1, T2, and myelin water fraction maps was proposed. Along with the harmonized calibration scan, this package could be a valuable tool for multi-site/multi-vendor neuroimaging studies in adult and pediatric populations.

This code requires [Pulseq](https://github.com/pulseq). [TOPPE](https://toppemri.github.io/) is used for running on GE scanners.
