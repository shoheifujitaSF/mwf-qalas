A vendor-agnostic sequence for joint and rapid acquisition of T1, T2, and myelin water fraction maps was proposed. Along with the harmonized calibration scan, this package could be a valuable tool for multi-site/multi-vendor neuroimaging studies in adult and pediatric populations.

This code requires [Pulseq](https://github.com/pulseq). [TOPPE](https://toppemri.github.io/) is used for running on GE scanners.
